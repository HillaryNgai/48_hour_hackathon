Project Detailed Description:   Today many Ultimate Software Customers are inundated with hundreds of applications. It may take many hours for a recruiter to sift through and identify the most highly qualified candidates. After identifying these top contenders, they still need to interview them. With Ulti Themis we propose to maximize recruiter time and effort by streamlining the interview process by incorporating automated video interviews and providing key candidate metrics such as culture match based on the information collected during these recorded sessions.
